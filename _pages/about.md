I am a driven cybersecurity student who attends The Pennsylvania State University and I am currently pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations. At just 16 years old I earned my CompTIA A+, and 17 my CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+ [certifications](https://www.credly.com/users/zachary-soled). I have a strong technical background, and that was only strengthened in High School where I attended a trade school and took Network Operations (Tripple Period) and Cybersecurity Capstone (Tripple Period) courses(s) across my last 2 years of high school further preparing me for my certifications, which helped me tremendously now to get a step ahead from other students. 

Practical Experience Matters
======
I have talked to many IT professionals, through various means of networking, more experienced people than me, and recruiters, and one countless sentence I get repeated over and over is this idea of "Active Learning" or better-known as learning hands-on. Over the years, I have developed an extremely strong set of technical skills, and soft skills. One of the main reasons why I emphasize this has to do with a story about why I got into Cybersecurity in the first place.

When I was a little kid I would always like to mess around with the computer, and I would install software just because I was curious. Well, eventually I ended up installing malware which was a type of adware that puts ads all over the screen, unannounced to say, I was from then on admin-restricted on that computer because my father had to clean the computer. Since then, I have always been curious about how things work, and how to prevent them, and I kinda became obsessed with it. 

My theoretical knowledge from my certifications is nice, but practical knowledge is what matters to employers. I will continue to search for internships throughout college and continue to build my project resume and share knowledge with other Cybersecurity "professionals" / inspiring "professionals." Use that word lightly, because I don't think anyone can be a professional in cybersecurity, because you really will never know everything. 

The Soled Family's Personal Helpdesk
======
I wish life was so simple that I could put this on my resume but I have been working for free probably for over 6 years, from removing malware, and fixing printers (the worst), to my mother screaming at me that the internet is broken, when in reality it's just her phone, I have a lot of experience when it comes to technical troubleshooting of computers. In my family, I was the person to go to when it came to a computer problem. 

Ever since I have been certified by CompTIA, I have made a countless effort to educate my family about various forms of fraud, phishing, and other cybersecurity problems that can be easily avoided if you're made aware of them. No Mom that's not USPS telling you in broken English that your "parcel cannot be delivered."
